# Glassmorphism in SwiftUI (example app)

## Description

This app renders a glassmorphic 3D card that can be rotated in 3D space, and have it's color changed by the user.

## Purpose

This is an example app, not to be put on the app store, but to teach other people how they can achieve a similar effect. The [tutorial](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSKNwXgMmY8/) on this effect can be found on my Instagram: [Click here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSKNwXgMmY8/).
